Couldn't quite get the damping working right, after trying several solutions. Still beats doing the real differential equations though...


For debugging and sanity, I let you pick where the force of the spider's jump is applied.
It can be nowhere (x), just where it's jumping from (o), where it's going to (n), or both (space).
